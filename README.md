# paper-scissors-rock-game
This was coding project from [The Odin's Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

This was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As this was my first JavaScript project, the main learning curve was learning how to use JavaScript in conjuction with HTML and CSS. Through this project I learned how to use a range of HTML DOM element and style objects such as document.getElementByID, style.display, onclick, and .innerHTML. These were used to allow the player to select a choice in which hand to play, to keep track of the score, and to have a 'play again' button appear once the game is over.
